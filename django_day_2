import datetime

# Create your views here.

def time_info_view(request):
    time = datetime.datetime.now()
    output = '<h1> Currently the time is ' + str(time) + '</h1>'
    return HttpResponse(output)

Single Project with Multiple Applications. 

1) Creation of Project: 
django-admin startproject multiProject

2) Creation of Applications - One, Two 
cd multiProject
python3 manage.py startapp One
python3 manage.py startapp Two

3) Adding These two applications to Project: 
   - Open settings.py - INSTALLED_APPS - 'One','Two'

4) Create Views for these two applications in their respective views.py file. 
    Eg. 
from django.http import HttpResponse
import datetime

# Create your views here.

def time_info_view(request):
    time = datetime.datetime.now()
    output = '<h1> Currently in Application 2, the time is ' + str(time) + '</h1>'
    return HttpResponse(output)

5) Add these views in urls.py 
from one import views
from two import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('time/', views.time_info_view),
    path('time2/', views.time_info_view)
]
Ambiguity: 
Here comes the ambiguity.  Observe the above urlspatterns.  It is not clear that which times_info_view function from which urlpattern will be called. 

Solution: 
Approach #1: 

urls.py: 
--------------
from one.views import time_info_view
from two.views import time_info_view2

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('time/', time_info_view),
    path('time2/', time_info_view2)
]
        
6) Now run the server.  
python3 manage.py runserver

Approach #2: 

urls.py: 
-------
from one import views as v1
from two import views as v2

    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('time/', v1.time_info_view),
    path('time2/', v2.time_info_view2)
]

How to Change Time Zone to IST:
